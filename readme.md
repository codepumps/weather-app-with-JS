# Weather App with Javascript

In this project, you can see the dark mode and weather forecast.<br/>
When I code weather forecast app, I got the weather forecast API from the https://openweathermap.org/city <br/>
What can you do in this project?
<ul>
<li>You can change the background of the site.</li>
